### Key Technologies and Their Roles

1. **Java & JDBC**  
   Java powers the core business logic and handles database connectivity through JDBC, allowing smooth communication between the application and the Oracle database.

2. **MyBatis**  
   Used for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), MyBatis simplifies database interaction by mapping SQL queries to Java objects, making the code more maintainable.

3. **JSP, JSTL, EL**  
   These technologies were used to create dynamic web pages and manage the interaction between the front-end and back-end, enabling a seamless user experience.

4. **Ajax**  
   Integrated for asynchronous communication, ensuring that actions like booking a room or checking availability are quick and don't require full-page reloads.

5. **Oracle Database**  
   The backbone of the system, Oracle Database stores all user and booking data securely, supporting complex queries and efficient data management.
